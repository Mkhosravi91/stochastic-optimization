# Surplus‚ÄêAllocation Stochastic Optimization

A two‚Äêstage stochastic programming model (implemented in GAMS) to determine the optimal surplus quantity for each product‚Äôs demand forecast. Demand uncertainty is modeled via Burr12‚Äêbased variance multipliers, scenarios are clustered with K-Means, and the resulting Sample Average Approximation (SAA) is solved in GAMS.

## Overview

In this project, we identify‚Äîfor each product‚Äîthe optimal ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù quantity S<sub>i</sub> to add to its nominal forecast D<sub>i</sub>, so as to maximize expected profit under demand uncertainty. Rather than sampling absolute demand directly, we sample a variance multiplier from a Burr12 distribution and compute realized demand.


We generate 10 000 such scenarios per product, reduce them via K-Means clustering to K ‚âà 1000 representative scenarios (with associated weights), and then solve the deterministic-equivalent SAA model in GAMS (`surplus.gms`). The final output is an Excel file containing optimal surplus decisions and scenario-by-scenario recourse metrics.

## Prerequisites

- **GAMS 36.1+** installed and on your system PATH.  
- **Python 3.8+** with the following packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `scipy`  
  - `openpyxl`  
- **git** for version control.  

> It‚Äôs recommended to use a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

## Methodology / How It Works


### **Two-Stage Stochastic Formulation**  
   ‚Ä¢ Surplus variable is the only first-stage decision variables, represents the surplus quantity added to product i nominal forecast D·µ¢ and the the second stage variables are sales/shortages, once demand realizes.  
   ‚Ä¢ The key constraints are related to capacity, macro-target, and group substitution.  
   ‚Ä¢ Expected profit is maximized, but because demand is random, we approximate it using scenarios.

### **Scenario Generation (Monte Carlo on Variance)**  
   ‚Ä¢ Demand is not sampled directly. Instead, for each product <code>i</code>, a variance factor is drawn from a Burr12 distribution. The realized demand for product <code>i</code> under scenario <code>sc</code> is calculated as:</p>

DÃÉ<sub>i,sc</sub> = D<sub>i</sub> √ó demandVar<sub>i,sc</sub>
 
   ‚Ä¢ Using the Python notebook <code>KMEANS.ipynb</code>, 10 000 values of <code>DÃÉ<sub>i,sc</sub></code> are generated for each product using Monte Carlo simulation. To reduce the problem size, the 10 000 √ó |I| demand matrix is processed using K-Means clustering in Python. The 10 000 points are clustered into <strong>K ‚âà 1000</strong> centroids, and each centroid‚Äôs weight is calculated as (cluster size) / 10 000. The resulting representative demands and their weights are saved for the GAMS model to <code>inputs.xlsx</code>.</p>

### **Scenario Reduction**  
   ‚Ä¢ Our Stochasting Programming model with 1000 scenarios is computationally intractable so we apply Sample Average Approximation (SAA) by solving many much smaller subsamples of size ùëÅ ‚â™ 100 and then statistically 
     combining their objective estimates against a larger reference set. This lets us approximate the true optimal value with far less computational effort.




### **Putting Everything Together**  
   ‚Ä¢ Summarize the pipeline:
   
     1. To run the model, place both surplus.gms and the K-Means output file (inputs.xlsx) into 
     
     ```makefile
     'C:\Users\<your-Windows-username>\Documents\gamsdir\projdir'

(replacing <your-Windows-username> with whatever folder name you see under C:\Users\). Then, from a terminal opened in that folder, execute: surplus.gms lo=2.  
     2. GAMS will import `inputs.xlsx`, solve the deterministic-equivalent SAA, and write the results to `surpluses.xlsx` in the same directory. Open `surpluses.xlsx` to view the optimal surplus 
        decisions and scenario-by-scenario recourse metrics.
